This applies to small problems like being stuck in traffic jams as well as bigger issues such as getting your dream job. Patience makes it easier to live because it reduces negative emotions like stress, anger, or frustration. When one is patient, one is calmer and more open to changes.",

Trust in a leader allows organizations and communities to flourish, while the absence of trust can cause fragmentation, conflict and even war. That’s why we need to trust our leaders, our family members, our friends and our co-workers, albeit in different ways.",

        "Loss of trust could causing us to withdraw our energy and level of engagement. As a result, we pull back from that person and no longer feel part of their world. But on the positive side, trust makes people feel eager to be part of a relationship or group, with a shared purpose and a willingness to depend on each other. When trust is intact, we will willingly contribute what is needed, not just by offering our presence, but also by sharing our dedication, talent, energy and honest thoughts on how the relationship or group is working."

When you do something consistently over time, you’ll notice that the new habit will gradually replace the old one. And it becomes a routine. One way to become disciplined is to consistently do a thing over a long time. We can’t train ourself to do things in a controlled manner if we don’t do it repeatedly. And we can’t be consistent if you aren’t disciplined. ",
